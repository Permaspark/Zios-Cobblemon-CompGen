# Zios-Cobblemon-CompGen
A simple Python script to expedite the creation of competitively viable Pokemon in Cobblemon using /pokegive.

This script is very user friendly, and will both ask for the accurate inputs as well as tell the user if their input is not possible. At the end, a command will be generated for easy use in-game.

To repeat for multiple mons, just type "Y" or "Yes" after a command is generated.
